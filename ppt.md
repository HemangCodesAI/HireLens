### **Title: Automating HR with Agentic AI**  
*(Slide 1: Title Slide – Project Name: Automated Job Posting and Interview Preparation System, Your Name: Hemang Joshi)*  

---

### **Slide 2: Introduction**  
- Briefly introduce the problem:  
  - Traditional HR processes are time-consuming and resource-intensive.  
  - Manual job posting creation and candidate evaluation can be inconsistent.  
- Present the solution:  
  - Using **Agentic AI** to automate job postings and resume analysis.  

---

### **Slide 3: What is Agentic AI?**  
- Definition:  
  - Agentic AI refers to multiple LLM instances working together as specialized agents.  
- How it works:  
  - Agents collaborate, improve each other’s responses, and use specialized tools.  

---

### **Slide 4: Project Overview**  
- Explain the core functionality:  
  - Automated job posting creation.  
  - Candidate resume comparison against job requirements.  
  - Each AI agent specializes in a task.  

---

### **Slide 5: System Architecture**  
- Show a high-level diagram of how different AI agents interact.  
- Mention the tools used (LLM models, APIs, databases).  

---

### **Slide 6: Types of AI Agents Used**  
1. **Research Agent** – Gathers job trends and descriptions using web search.  
2. **Writer Agent** – Generates structured job postings.  
3. **Evaluator Agent** – Compares resumes with job descriptions and scores candidates.  
4. **Reviewer Agent** – Refines and improves responses from other agents.  

---

### **Slide 7: Workflow – Job Posting Creation**  
- Step 1: Research agent fetches similar job descriptions.  
- Step 2: Writer agent drafts the job post.  
- Step 3: Reviewer agent refines and finalizes the post.  
- *(Include a screenshot of an AI-generated job post.)*  

---

### **Slide 8: Workflow – Resume Comparison**  
- Step 1: Extract skills and qualifications from the job post.  
- Step 2: Parse candidate resumes.  
- Step 3: Evaluator agent scores candidates based on fit.  
- *(Include a sample resume evaluation screenshot.)*  

---

### **Slide 9: Example – Job Posting Creation**  
- Show an example job posting generated by the AI.  

---

### **Slide 10: Example – Resume Matching Process**  
- Show a table comparing job requirements and candidate qualifications.  

---

### **Slide 11: Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **LLMs Used:** GPT, Claude, Mistral, etc.  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** LangChain, OpenAI API, Pandas, Flask.  
- **Integration with:** Vector databases, Web scraping tools.  

---

### **Slide 12: Advantages of This Approach**  
- **Efficiency:** Speeds up hiring workflows.  
- **Scalability:** Can handle multiple job postings & candidates simultaneously.  
- **Consistency:** Eliminates human bias & ensures structured hiring.  

---

### **Slide 13: Challenges & Limitations**  
- LLM hallucinations and fact-checking.  
- Handling domain-specific job postings.  
- Data privacy concerns with resumes.  

---

### **Slide 14: Future Improvements**  
- **Enhancing Resume Parsing Accuracy.**  
- **Fine-tuning LLMs for HR-specific tasks.**  
- **Integration with external ATS platforms.**  

---

### **Slide 15: Conclusion & Demo**  
- Recap: **Automating HR using Agentic AI.**  
- Live demo (if applicable) or final screenshots.  
- Invite questions from the audience.
